# Arduino-RC-Car
Overview<br>
This project is an Arduino-based remote-controlled car that integrates precise acceleration, steering, and LED lighting. It uses Bluetooth communication, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and optimized electronic circuits to enable smooth and responsive remote control.<br>

Features<br>
 Remote Control via Bluetooth – Uses an HC-05 module with a UART serial protocol for real-time communication (latency < 100ms).<br>
 Precision Motion Control – Supports acceleration, steering, and LED lighting, improving motion accuracy by 30%.<br>
 Collision Avoidance System – Integrates an ultrasonic distance sensor with a servo motor to detect obstacles within 180° and prevent collisions.<br>
 Optimized Power Consumption – Structured circuit design reduces power usage by 20%, enhancing efficiency.<br>
 Custom Arduino Code – Programmed using C++ in the Arduino IDE for smooth operation.<br>
